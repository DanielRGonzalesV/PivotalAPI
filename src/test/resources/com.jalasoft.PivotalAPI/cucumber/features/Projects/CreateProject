Feature: Project

  @create_project
  Scenario Outline: Status code 200 when create new Project with name only
    Given I have set a connection to pivotal_tracker API service
    When I send project a POST request to projects with name project <nameProject>
    Then I expect Status the projects code 200
    And I expect JSON for the name project equal a <nameProject>

  Examples:
  | nameProject |
  | Project_Home12 |
