Feature: DeleteProject

    Background: Create a new Project
    Given I have set a connection to pivotal_tracker API service
    When I send a POST request to /projects with:
      |name|aaaaa99912161|
      |public|true|

  Scenario: Status code 200 when delete project
    When I send a DELETE request to /projects
    Then I expect Status code 204
